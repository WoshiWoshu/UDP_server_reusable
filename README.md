# UDP_server_reusable
Reusable multi-threaded UDP server/client in C++ built by me containing a Modular interface + heritages that can be adapted to any new implementations and even new protocols like TCP.
In this implementations i adapted the software to be a FTP (File Transfer Protocol) that can sends and receives audio files between clients. The server is in charge of redistributions, processing of messages (serializations) and handling new requests.

USAGE :

1) Make

From one terminal
